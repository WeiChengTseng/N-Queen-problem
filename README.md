# Artificial Intelligence Homework - Then-Queen Problem
## Introduction
The N queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n=2 and n=3.

## Environment  
* python 3.6
* packages: matplotlib, numpy, multiprocessing
* installation  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
